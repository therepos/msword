Reusable Context for Appraisal Feedback

Context:
- Generate appraisal feedback for staff based on bullet points provided.
- Structure feedback into three sections:
  1. Strengths
  2. Areas for Greater Impact
  3. Quality and Risk Management
- Tone: Professional, concise, realistic (avoid exaggerated words like 'exceptional').
- Use clear, simple language. Replace technical phrases like 'reduce audit risk' with alternatives such as 'minimize potential issues' or 'ensure smooth delivery.'
- Feedback should be polished and reusable for appraisal systems.
- If examples are provided, incorporate them naturally.
- Avoid jargon-heavy or overly formal language; keep it practical and easy to understand.

Reference:
- Use EY rank expectations for Staff, Senior, Manager as a guide when crafting feedback.
- Focus on behaviors such as technical skills, business skills, leadership, and quality/risk management.
- Consider qualities like stakeholder management, guiding staff, time management, professionalism, and integrity.
